your personal information, obtained through the web site, will be dealt with. This Privacy
Policy will be reviewed periodically so please check regularly so that you are updated
on any changes. We welcome your comments and feedback.

&nbsp;
<h4>
Personal Information</h4>
Personal information about visitors to our site is collected only when knowingly and
voluntarily submitted. For example, we may need to collect such information to provide
you with further services or to answer or forward any requests or enquiries. It is our
intention that this policy will protect your personal information from being dealt with in
any way that is inconsistent with applicable privacy laws in Australia.

&nbsp;
<h4>
Use of Information</h4>
Personal information that visitors submit to our site is used only for the purpose for
which it is submitted or for such other secondary purposes that are related to the
primary purpose, unless we disclose other uses in this Privacy Policy or at the time of
collection. Copies of correspondence sent from the web site, that may contain personal
information, are stored as archives for record-keeping and back-up purposes only.

&nbsp;
<h4>
Collecting information on Registered members</h4>
As part of registering with us, we collect and retain personal information about you in

purpose for which it was collected; or for a related secondary purpose where you would
reasonably expect us to use or disclose the personal information for that secondary
purpose. We may otherwise use and disclose your personal information if you have
given us consent for the use or disclosure or it is required or authorised by law.
Apart from where you have consented or disclosure is necessary to achieve the
purpose for which it was submitted, personal information may be disclosed in special
situations where we have reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify,
contact or bring legal action against anyone damaging, injuring, or interfering
(intentionally or unintentionally) with our rights or property, users, or anyone else
who could be harmed by such activities. We may engage contractors or other service
providers to provide you with goods or services on our behalf. In that circumstance,
we may disclose your personal information to those third parties in order to meet your
request for goods or services.

Playz respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information.
Our privacy policy outlines our approach to privacy and how we collect, use and protect
your personal information. It also sets out your rights in relation to accessing the
personal information we collect and hold about you. We are bound by the Australian
Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).

&nbsp;
We reserve the right, occasionally, to modify or remove portions of this Internet Privacy
Policy at any time. This Privacy Policy is in addition to any other terms and conditions
applicable to the web site. We do not make any representations about third party web
sites that are linked to or referenced from this web site.

&nbsp;
We recognise the importance of protecting the privacy of information collected about
visitors to our web site, in particular information that is capable of identifying an
individual ("personal information"). This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which
your personal information, obtained through the web site, will be dealt with. This Privacy
Policy will be reviewed periodically so please check regularly so that you are updated
on any changes. We welcome your comments and feedback.

&nbsp;
<h4>Personal Information</h4>
Personal information about visitors to our site is collected only when knowingly and
voluntarily submitted. For example, we may need to collect such information to provide
you with further services or to answer or forward any requests or enquiries. It is our
intention that this policy will protect your personal information from being dealt with in
any way that is inconsistent with applicable privacy laws in Australia.

&nbsp;
<h4>Use of Information</h4>
Personal information that visitors submit to our site is used only for the purpose for
which it is submitted or for such other secondary purposes that are related to the
primary purpose, unless we disclose other uses in this Privacy Policy or at the time of
collection. Copies of correspondence sent from the web site, that may contain personal
information, are stored as archives for record-keeping and back-up purposes only.

given us consent for the use or disclosure or it is required or authorised by law.
Apart from where you have consented or disclosure is necessary to achieve the
purpose for which it was submitted, personal information may be disclosed in special
situations where we have reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify,
contact or bring legal action against anyone damaging, injuring, or interfering
(intentionally or unintentionally) with our rights or property, users, or anyone else
who could be harmed by such activities. We may engage contractors or other service
providers to provide you with goods or services on our behalf. In that circumstance,
we may disclose your personal information to those third parties in order to meet your
request for goods or services.

Our privacy policy outlines our approach to privacy and how we collect, use and protect
your personal information. It also sets out your rights in relation to accessing the
personal information we collect and hold about you. We are bound by the Australian
Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).

&nbsp;
We reserve the right, occasionally, to modify or remove portions of this Internet Privacy
Policy at any time. This Privacy Policy is in addition to any other terms and conditions
applicable to the web site. We do not make any representations about third party web
sites that are linked to or referenced from this web site.

&nbsp;
We recognise the importance of protecting the privacy of information collected about
visitors to our web site, in particular information that is capable of identifying an
individual ("personal information"). This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which
your personal information, obtained through the web site, will be dealt with. This Privacy
Policy will be reviewed periodically so please check regularly so that you are updated
on any changes. We welcome your comments and feedback.

&nbsp;
<h4>Personal Information</h4>
Personal information about visitors to our site is collected only when knowingly and
voluntarily submitted. For example, we may need to collect such information to provide
you with further services or to answer or forward any requests or enquiries. It is our
intention that this policy will protect your personal information from being dealt with in
any way that is inconsistent with applicable privacy laws in Australia.

&nbsp;
<h4>Use of Information</h4>
Personal information that visitors submit to our site is used only for the purpose for
which it is submitted or for such other secondary purposes that are related to the
primary purpose, unless we disclose other uses in this Privacy Policy or at the time of
collection. Copies of correspondence sent from the web site, that may contain personal
information, are stored as archives for record-keeping and back-up purposes only.

given us consent for the use or disclosure or it is required or authorised by law.
Apart from where you have consented or disclosure is necessary to achieve the

contact or bring legal action against anyone damaging, injuring, or interfering
(intentionally or unintentionally) with our rights or property, users, or anyone else
who could be harmed by such activities. We may engage contractors or other service
providers to provide you with goods or services on our behalf. In that circumstance,
we may disclose your personal information to those third parties in order to meet your

Playz refers to Playz Holdings Pty Ltd in its own right, it\'s associated bodies, and includes any of its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, other partners and employees, and may be referred to as, "We", "our" and "us" in this Privacy Policy. By using this site, you, the user of this web site, agree to the Internet Privacy Policy of this web site ("the web site"), which is set out on this web site page.

Playz respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. Our privacy policy outlines our approach to privacy and how we collect, use and protect your personal information. It also sets out your rights in relation to accessing the personal information we collect and hold about you. We are bound by the Australian Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).

We reserve the right, occasionally, to modify or remove portions of this Internet Privacy Policy at any time. This Privacy Policy is in addition to any other terms and conditions applicable to the web site. We do not make any representations about third party web sites that are linked to or referenced from this web site.

We recognise the importance of protecting the privacy of information collected about visitors to our web site, in particular information that is capable of identifying an
individual ("personal information"). This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which your personal information, obtained through the web site, will be dealt with. This Privacy Policy will be reviewed periodically so please check regularly so that you are updated on any changes. We welcome your comments and feedback.
<h4>Personal Information</h4>
Personal information about visitors to our site is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted. For example, we may need to collect such information to provide you with further services or to answer or forward any requests or enquiries. It is our intention that this policy will protect your personal information from being dealt with in any way that is inconsistent with applicable privacy laws in Australia.
<h4>Use of Information</h4>
Personal information that visitors submit to our site is used only for the purpose for which it is submitted or for such other secondary purposes that are related to the primary purpose, unless we disclose other uses in this Privacy Policy or at the time of collection. Copies of correspondence sent from the web site, that may contain personal information, are stored as archives for record-keeping and back-up purposes only.

<h4>Disclosure</h4>
We will generally use or disclose your personal information only for the primary purpose for which it was collected; or for a related secondary purpose where you would reasonably expect us to use or disclose the personal information for that secondary purpose. We may otherwise use and disclose your personal information if you have given us consent for the use or disclosure or it is required or authorised by law. Apart from where you have consented or disclosure is necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was submitted, personal information may be disclosed in special situations where we have reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against anyone damaging, injuring, or interfering (intentionally or unintentionally) with our rights or property, users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We may engage contractors or other service providers to provide you with goods or services on our behalf. In that circumstance, we may disclose your personal information to those third parties in order to meet your request for goods or services.
<h4>Security</h4>
We strive to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personal information submitted to this website, and we review and update our security measures in light of current technologies.
